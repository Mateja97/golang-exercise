2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Protocol Buffers**:
   - Install the `protoc` compiler if you havenâ€™t already.
   - Generate the Go code from `.proto` files:
     ```bash
     protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/*.proto
     ```

## Running the Main Application

   You can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start all required services (Kafka, Zookeeper, Postgres, and the CompanyService):
   ```bash
   ./init.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Start all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Create the Kafka topic `events`.
